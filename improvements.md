## Improvements

this is the list of possible improvements that can be made in this app

1. Change sqlite3 database to PostgreSQL
2. Dockerize the application, with separate containers for databsae and the app itself
3. Add authentication, and apply permissions to the endpoints to restrict usage (JWT or simple token auth)
4. Use pytest with FactoryBoy for testing instead of regular Django test tools (optional, use it if the default tools are not enough)
